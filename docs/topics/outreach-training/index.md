# Outreach and Training

Welcome! If you are involved in outreach, communications, or training aspects of establishing a Federated EGA node, you are in the right place.

**You might find this page useful if you are:**
- a data steward
- a support officer
- an outreach or communications officer
- coordinating, organising, or providing training

**By exploring these materials, you will be able to:**
- Interact with FEGA communication channels
- Find FEGA outreach materials
- Share news and updates related to FEGA and its nodes

## 1. Engage communication channels

### Internal channels
- The <a href="https://elixir-europe.org/communities/human-data" target="_blank">ELIXIR Federated Human Data (FHD) Community</a> is the main entry-point for a Node interested in joining the FEGA Network:
  - Join the <a href="https://elixir-europe.org/intranet/join-groups" target="_blank">ELIXIR FHD Mailing List</a> (select "Human Data") to hear about the latest updates and events from the FHD community. You will need to log-in into the ELIXIR intranet.
  - Attend the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10OwVvHbJ7i1gI1Iw4zmVsOs8kDrG077Y52juehiFcmU/edit" target="_blank">ELIXIR FHD Community Calls</a> to engage with the FEGA community.
- Federated EGA has mailing lists for various communications: 
  - FEGA Strategic Committee mailing list (invitation-only): For discussing strategic planning and direction of FEGA.
  - FEGA Operations Committee mailing list (invitation-only): For reviewing operational performance and coordinating technical roadmaps.

### External channels
